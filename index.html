        <p>The Deezed Man Collective (DMC) is a <b>music collective</b> born on the suburban outskirts of Toronto, Ontario.
          Influenced by an eclectic and groovy fusion of rock, blues, jazz, R&B, pop, and a dash of progressive metal, our fresh sound can get any crowd to jam along.</p>
        <p>Members of the DMC have performed at the <mark>Beaches International Jazz Festival</mark>, toured throughout <mark>China</mark>, and performed at events across Southern Ontario - most recently for the <mark>2019 Aurora Winter Festival at Ontario Place</mark>.</p>
        <p>The DMC’s debut single titled <mark><a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/35aKMPGOUbxuRqbQ65LvL9">For You</a></mark> is available on all major streaming platforms, and we're currently working on our first album.

        <h1>Before they were deezed...</h1>
        <p>It all started in the mid-2000s, when childhood friends Anthony Nufrio (guitar & vocals), Matthew Reyes (drums), and Kyle Palmer (bass) picked up their first instrument in grade school music class.
            Starting with favorite songs, then slowly fiddling with soundtracks, the group had developed an amazing chemistry together. </p>
        <p>But college and university put them on separate paths for years, until the trio finally reunited in 2019.
            Joined by talented friends they made along the way - Ramy Zhang (vocals) and John Salazar (keys) - they’re picking up where they left off, and are ready to make some real good music.</p>
